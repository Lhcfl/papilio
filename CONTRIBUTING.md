## Technical Informations

### React

Papilio is built using React. If you're not familiar with React, we recommend checking out the official [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) to get started.

[React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) is used for building the project. Thus, you can safely forget your `useMemo`, `useCallback` worries and focus on writing clean and simple code.

### TypeScript

Papilio is developed using TypeScript. If you're new to TypeScript, please refer to the official [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) for more information.

Please make sure to pass strict type checks when contributing code to Papilio. This helps maintain code quality and prevents potential runtime errors.

### TanStack

Papilio uses TanStack libraries such as [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) and [React Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) for data fetching and routing. Familiarity with these libraries will be beneficial when contributing to the project.
